    "If we want to avoid obstacles, we need to use a sensor to detect the obstacles. Particularly, our Turtlebot3 robot includes a 2D laser range finder: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_lds_01/ . \n",
    "The Gazebo simulator is able to simulate this sensor among many others. Therefore, we can read the 2D laser scan readings, since our simulator is publishing this data. We can see with the tool rqt the publications. In this case we are interested in /scan topic [sensor_msgs/LaserScan].\n",
    "\n",
    "From a 2D laser scan we obtain a set of distances (ranges) to the obstacles around the sensor. Each distance position in the vector of distances corresponds to a known angle, so we have a set of *polar coordinates* of the obstacles regarding the center of the sensor. \n",

    "We will develop some scripts in a new ROS package, the `collision_avoidance` package. The idea of any node inside this package is that it susbscribes to the `v_pref` topic (preferred velocity), which usually comes from the path tracker node. Then, taking into account the obstacles sensed by the laser sensor, it generates a collision-free velocity as close as possible to the desired and publishes it in the `cmd_vel` topic, which is received and executed by the Turtlebot itself. This idea is depicted in Fig. 1.\n",
