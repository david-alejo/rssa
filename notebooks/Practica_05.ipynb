    "Basically, our goal is to make our beloved Turtlebot go to a destination, which is given in a global coordinate frame, such as the `Odometry` frame, or the `Map` frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we will implement a node that receives (subscribes to) the goal. The basic idea here is to transform the pose in global coordinates (i. e. in the odometry or map coordinate frame) to the local frame (base_link frame). The pose in the local coordinate frame can be considered as the position error, or the position vector from the robot to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to transform the goal pose to local coordinates, we will need a class that is provided in the `tf` package, the TransformListener class. It implements a method that listens to the available transform in ROS and it provides us with some methods to transform between coordinate frames such as `transformPose` and `transformPoint`. For more information, please refer to the tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28Python%29\n",

    "+ Add a subscriber on this node the `move_base_simple/goal` topic with type `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`, which is linked to the goalRecieved callback method.\n",
    "+ In the callback method, the recieved goal is copied to a goal attribute of the TurtlebotController class and a message is shown for logging purposes.\n",
    "+ In the `control` method, which is periodically called, you should transform the pose from the original reference frame specified in the Header to a the base frame, which is specified in an attribute of the class `base_frame`. By default, this frame should be `base_footprint`.\n",
    "+ The `base_footprint` attribute should be configurable by means of the ROS parameter server, in a private ROS parameter of the node named: `base_frame_id`.\n"

As a first approximation, the students are encouraged to calculate the closest point from the robot to the path (see point C in Fig. 3).
