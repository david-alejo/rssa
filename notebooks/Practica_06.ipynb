    "We will develop some scripts in a new ROS package, the `collision_avoidance` package. The idea of any node inside this package is that it susbscribes to the `v_pref` topic (preferred velocity, of type `geometry_msgs/Twist`), which usually comes from the path tracker node. Then, taking into account the obstacles sensed by the laser sensor, it generates a collision-free velocity as close as possible to the desired and publishes it in the `cmd_vel` topic (same type as `v_pref`), which is received and executed by the Turtlebot itself. This idea is depicted in Fig. 2.\n",
