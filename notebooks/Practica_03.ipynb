    "In this practical session, we will learn the basics of Docker containers and how to use them to run ROS (Robot Operating System). ROS is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications, including hardware drivers, state-of-the-art algorithms, robotics simulators, powerful developer tools, and much more. ROS is open-source and has a strong support from the robotics community, so you can find a wide spectrum of available packages for your robotics application. Although ROS can run on different platforms, its most widely used and supported platform is Ubuntu. One option would be to install Ubuntu and ROS on your computer, but in this course we will use a more powerful tool, which is Docker containers. In particular, in this session, we'll learn a bit more about:\n",

    "\n",
    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. Docker allows developers to easily deploy their applications in a _**container**_ running on a host operating system. The container will package and run your application in an isolated environment that can be based on a different operating system. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources. Thus, you can run many containers simultaneously on a given host. As they are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. Moreover, you can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way."

    "### Main concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on an Ubuntu image, and install ROS and your robotics application on top, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run. An image is a standardized package that includes all the configuration files, binaries and libraries to run a container. Images are immutable, once created, they cannot be modified. You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it. Moreover, images are composed of layers, and each layer represents a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use images created by others and published in a registry or create your own images. To build your own image, you create a __Dockerfile__ with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Docker registries\n",
    "A Docker registry stores Docker images. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) is a public registry with over 100,000 images that you can run locally created by developers. By default, Docker searches for images on Docker Hub, but you could also run your own private registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Containers\n",
    "A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, or delete a container using the Docker GUI or CLI. You can run multiple containers from the same image, connect them to the same (or different) network, attach storage to them, etc. By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine, but this level of isolation can also be configured. \n",

VirtualBox or VMWare have their on hypervisor and may switch off Hyper-V for compatibility. If you find issues running WSL when starting Docker Desktop, make sure that Hyper-V is activated.
